Apple stock,"Trump just shook the global markets.
(And this might be the spark that sets off something bigger.)

He’s introduced sweeping tariffs—even on traditional allies. Even polar bears and penguins aren’t safe.

Apple’s stock dropped 10% on the news. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

Here’s what this actually means:
1) Apple’s global supply chain is under pressure
With key components sourced abroad, tariffs could send production costs soaring. U.S. prices rise. Global market share shrinks. Everyone feels it.

2) Even if tariffs are reversed—damage is done
Allies won’t just “move on.” They’ll adapt. They’ll decouple. Because depending on an unpredictable partner is no longer an option.

3) Recession risk just hit 50%
That’s the current estimate for the U.S. economy. When the world’s largest market slows down, the ripple effects go global.

I asked a friend who exports from Vietnam to the U.S. what he thinks.

He said, ""Honestly, I don’t know. We’re just waiting for some visibility.""

That sums up the mood: uncertainty.

With the market crashing, there may be buying opportunities— Just like we saw during COVID-19.

But don’t mistake falling prices for easy wins.

Nobody knows where the bottom is.

And nobody wants to catch a falling knife.

↳ Pass them to consumers and risk losing market share
↳ Rush production to other countries (which takes years)

Apple's shares fell by 5%, bringing its market cap below $2.6 trillion while Microsoft's stands at $2.65 trillion.

This change comes in the wake of heightened trade tensions between the United States and China. In a recent escalation, President Trump announced a 34% tariff increase on Chinese goods, effective April 9. In a tit-for-tat move, China imposed a similar 34% tariff on U.S. goods, prompting further potential tariff hikes. Apple's reliance on China for assembling about 90% of its products has left it vulnerable; the tech giant hasn't been able to secure any exemptions this time around, unlike during previous disputes.

As a result of these geopolitical pressures, Apple's stock has been the worst performer among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech companies over the past week. Tesla Inc. has also experienced a significant drop of around 21.5% since the tariff announcements.

At least one Wall Street analyst is pounding the table on Apple (AAPL). stock.

Amit Daryanani, a top five-star rated analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI (EVR), is encouraging investors to buy shares of the consumer electronics giant during the current market downturn, saying that Apple remains a “tech staple” and well-positioned to reap the benefits of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom in coming years.

Daryanani boosted his price target on AAPL stock to $275 from $260, and reiterated a Buy-equivalent outperform rating on the shares.

Evercore’s new price target is 30% higher than where Apple’s shares currently trade and one of the highest forecasts on Wall Street.

AAPL stock has taken a hit recently as the U.S. market has slumped.

Investors and analysts are also concerned about the company’s AI strategy and the slow deployment of new AI technologies.

However, Evercore is brushing aside those worries, saying that Apple is poised for continued growth.
