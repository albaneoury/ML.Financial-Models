Apple stock,"Trump just shook the global markets.
(And this might be the spark that sets off something bigger.)

He’s introduced sweeping tariffs—even on traditional allies. Even polar bears and penguins aren’t safe.

Apple’s stock dropped 10% on the news. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg.

Here’s what this actually means:
1) Apple’s global supply chain is under pressure
With key components sourced abroad, tariffs could send production costs soaring. U.S. prices rise. Global market share shrinks. Everyone feels it.

2) Even if tariffs are reversed—damage is done
Allies won’t just “move on.” They’ll adapt. They’ll decouple. Because depending on an unpredictable partner is no longer an option.

3) Recession risk just hit 50%
That’s the current estimate for the U.S. economy. When the world’s largest market slows down, the ripple effects go global.

I asked a friend who exports from Vietnam to the U.S. what he thinks.

He said, ""Honestly, I don’t know. We’re just waiting for some visibility.""

That sums up the mood: uncertainty.

With the market crashing, there may be buying opportunities— Just like we saw during COVID-19.

But don’t mistake falling prices for easy wins.

Nobody knows where the bottom is.

And nobody wants to catch a falling knife.

Trump just decided for you.

Trump's new tariff bomb just dropped on the tech industry: 54% on China, 46% on Vietnam, and 26% on India.

The $799 iPhone could soon cost you a staggering $1,142 in the US.

And Samsung just scored its biggest competitive advantage in years.

While Apple scrambles with Chinese tariffs, Samsung benefits from just a 10% tariff on South Korean imports.

Apple now faces an impossible choice:
↳ Absorb these costs and watch profits vanish
↳ Pass them to consumers and risk losing market share
↳ Rush production to other countries (which takes years)

The premium iPhone 16 Pro Max could hit nearly $2,300 – making Samsung's flagship models suddenly look like bargains.

Apple's shares already plunged 9.3% yesterday – their worst drop since March 2020.

“That compares to the steep declines in the major indexes mentioned earlier. They were all led lower by a 9.25%, 21-point plunge in Apple – the highest valued stock in the world (and my largest put option position). Even with today’s sharp decline, Apple’s P/E ratio is still over 32 times its relatively stagnant earnings. During the 2010-2019 decade, Apple’s revenue growth rate was 17.9%, yet its
average P/E ratio during that period was 16.2. Cut Apple’s stock in half from here, (Apple would be trading around $100)
and the stock would be valued as if it was still a relatively high growth company – which it is not (revenue growth is closer to
zero). Worse yet, no tech company is more exposed to margin pressures from the new tariffs than Apple. The vast majority of iPhones are assembled in China (54% tariff). Apple manufactures virtually nothing in the U.S. (0% tariffs). “

“ DAZN has lost ‘between €200 and €250 million’ in first year of Ligue 1 broadcast deal according to a report by L’Équipe. DAZN is just one year into a five-year broadcast agreement with LFP.

Since the Ligue 1 season kicked off, DAZN has only gained 500,000 subscribers, according to the company’s lawyer, meaning it has generated €120 million from them. If these figures are accurate, this means the network has lost €240 million this year, after paying a total €360 million for the league’s rights.

In February, DAZN initiated legal action against the LFP, demanding €573 million in compensation over alleged ‘breaches’ and ‘market dishonesty’. The company would later drop this case, with a mediator brought in by the Paris Commercial Court to help resolve its dispute with LFP.

Despite this, RMC Sport reported earlier this month that DAZN is looking to terminate its Ligue 1 deal at the end of the 2024/25 season.”

AAPL,"💰 Apple’s $600B Stock Buyback Strategy: A Game-Changer in Finance! 🚀📈
Apple has spent over $600 billion on stock repurchases since 2012, making it the largest buyback program in history! This strategic financial move boosted Apple’s stock, increased investor confidence, and set new corporate finance trends.

📊 Key Financial Numbers (2024):
✅ Total Buybacks Since 2012: $600+ billion
✅ New Buyback (May 2024): $110 billion (largest ever in the U.S.)
✅ Q2 2024 Revenue: $90.75 billion
✅ Q2 2024 Net Income: $23.64 billion
✅ Stock Surge After Buyback Announcement: +7% 📈
✅ Market Cap Growth:

2018: First company to hit $1 trillion
2024: Valuation at $2.86 trillion
🔥 Why This Strategy Works:
🔹 Fewer Outstanding Shares = Higher Earnings Per Share (EPS)
🔹 Stronger Market Signal = More Investor Confidence
🔹 Tax Efficiency = Better Alternative to Dividends
🔹 Debt Financing = Smart Capital Optimization

Apple’s buyback program reshaped corporate finance, inspiring companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta to follow suit!

AAPL,"I'm thrilled to share my latest project in algorithmic trading—a Python-based system that scans US stocks for opportunities using a classic technical analysis method: the SMA crossover strategy (50-day vs. 100-day SMAs). This project not only automates trade signal generation but also incorporates robust risk management with a 1:2 risk-reward exit strategy, culminating in a user-friendly Tkinter dashboard to review the backtested portfolio.
Project Overview
Objective:
To create a trading algorithm that identifies entry signals when the short-term 50-day SMA crosses above the long-term 100-day SMA. The system then simulates trades by setting a stop-loss based on recent lows and a target price at a 1:2 risk-reward ratio.

Technical Stack

Python: The core programming language used throughout the project.

yfinance: For fetching historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. A key challenge was handling the multi-index columns returned by yfinance; the solution was to flatten these columns for seamless data manipulation.

Pandas & Numpy: These libraries powered the data manipulation, SMA calculations, and overall backtesting logic.

Tkinter: Used to build a simple yet effective GUI that displays the portfolio performance after backtesting, making the results easily accessible at a glance.


How It Works
Data Retrieval & Preprocessing:
The system fetches one year of daily stock data for a list of US tickers. By flattening multi-index columns (e.g., converting ('Close', 'AAPL') to Close), I ensured smooth downstream processing.

SMA Calculation & Signal Generation:
The algorithm calculates the 50-day and 100-day SMAs.
A buy signal is generated when the 50-day SMA crosses above the 100-day SMA.

Risk Management & Trade Simulation:
Stop-Loss: Determined by finding the lowest low over the 10 days preceding the entry signal.

Target Price: Set at twice the risk (1:2 risk-reward), meaning if the risk is defined as the difference between the entry price and stop-loss, the target is the entry plus twice that amount.
The system simulates trades on a day-by-day basis, logging whether the stop-loss or target is hit.

User Interface:
Post-backtesting, a Tkinter-based GUI displays the portfolio summary. This dashboard provides a clear, tabular view of trade details such as entry/exit dates, entry price, stop-loss, target price, and outcome, making it easy to evaluate performance.

AAPL,"I'm excited to share project that dives into stock price prediction by leveraging both time series analysis and machine learning techniques. For this project, I focused on AAPL, the stock ticker for Apple Inc, one of the most dynamic and innovative companies in the tech sector. Working with Apple's stock data provided a unique opportunity to analyze real-world market behavior using robust statistical models.

The project involved a careful division of the data to ensure a realistic evaluation of the models' predictive power. I used historical data to train the models and reserved the most recent two months as a test set to evaluate performance. This approach allowed me to build and compare a range of forecasting models, including a traditional ARIMA model and several machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
